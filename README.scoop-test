When changes are made to the E2E export documents requiring modifications
of the health-data-standards E2E importer code, the records stored in mongod
are likely to change.  When this happens, the file
test/fixtures/scoop-records.json will need to be updated.

Use util/relay-service.rb to load the updated test patient records into
the mongod.  Then export these mongod test patient records using:

mongoexport -d query_gateway_development -c records > /tmp/scoop-records.json

Use the export to update ./test/fixtures/scoop-records.json
