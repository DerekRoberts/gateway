To run the unit, functional and integration tests, from the root directory
of the repository execute

   rake test

When changes are made to the E2E export documents requiring modifications
of the health-data-standards E2E importer code, or the health-data-standards
E2E importer code is changed for any other reason, the records stored in
mongod are likely to change.  When this happens, the file
test/fixtures/scoop-records.json will need to be updated.

Use util/relay-service.rb to load the updated test patient records into
the mongod.  Then export these mongod test patient records using:

mongoexport -d query_gateway_development -c records > /tmp/scoop-records.json

Use the export to update ./test/fixtures/scoop-records.json
